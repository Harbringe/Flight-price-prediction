# Flight-price-prediction
In this notebook, we will be using machine learning to predict the price of flights. We will use a dataset of flights from Kaggle. The dataset contains information about flights, such as the airline, the source and destination cities, the departure and arrival times, the class of seat, the number of days before the flight, and the ticket price.

We will use a variety of machine learning techniques to predict the price of flights. We will start by using a simple linear regression model. We will then use a more complex model, such as a random forest model. We will evaluate the performance of our models using a variety of metrics, such as the mean squared error and the R-squared value.

In the end, we will choose the best model based on its performance
